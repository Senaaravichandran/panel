# 🧑‍💻 React Admin Panel (Beginner-Friendly)

Hi there! 👋 This is a **fully responsive Admin Panel** built using **React (with functional components + hooks)**, **CSS (no Tailwind)**, and **Framer Motion for cool animations**. It’s designed for beginners — clean code, no fluff, and very easy to follow.

💡 The app has:
- A collapsible sidebar with icons & text
- A top navbar with a search bar and user profile dropdown
- A dashboard page with stat cards
- A user table with action buttons (View, Edit, Delete)
- Smooth transitions, hover effects, and full responsiveness
